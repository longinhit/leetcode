-- Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named
-- Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
-- 
-- 
-- +----+------------------+
-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- | 3  | john@example.com |
-- +----+------------------+
-- Id is the primary key column for this table.
-- 
-- 
-- For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have
-- the following rows:
-- 
-- 
-- +----+------------------+
-- | Id | Email            |
-- +----+------------------+
-- | 1  | john@example.com |
-- | 2  | bob@example.com  |
-- +----+------------------+
-- 
-- 
-- Note:
-- 
-- Your output is the whole PersonÂ table after executing your sql. Use delete
-- statement.
-- 
--
-- # Write your MySQL query statement below
delete from Person where Email in (
     SELECT A.Email from (
        select count(id) as id_num, min(id) as min_id, Email from Person GROUP BY Email HAVING id_num > 1
    ) as A 
) and id not in (
    SELECT A.min_id from (
        select count(id) as id_num, min(id) as min_id, Email from Person GROUP BY Email HAVING id_num > 1
    ) as A 
)
